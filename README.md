## Problem Statement
With a boom in the food and beverage industry, Sydney still has no central marketplace platform for restaurant owners and managers.

Many still have to unproductively physically travel to the sydney flemington markets at ungodly hours to purchase stock. Finding a trustworthy supplier is difficult having to reply on testing suppliers manually which can have devestating effects when partnering with unscruplous suppliers.


## Solution
A online marketplace for wholesalers, produces and growers can interact and trade. Generate trust between stakeholders via implementation of a two way rating system which will weed out untrustworthy users and reward great ones.
